# ALPB-Pitching-Widget1

The Atlantic League of Professional Baseball (ALPB) is the highest-level professional baseball league outside of MLB. This project aims to develop a standalone Shiny App widget in R, mirroring the existing ALPB hitting widget but tailored for pitchers. The app will allow users to analyze and track key pitching metrics such as Earned Run Average (ERA) and Walks and Hits per Inning Pitched (WHIP). Designed for coaches, recruiters, and fans, it will provide valuable insights into pitchers' performances.
